The Spanish and British governments appeared Wednesday to be seeking shelter from the political storm brewing over the possible extradition of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet to Spain. The court's plenary is expected to meet next week to decide on an earlier challenge of the Spanish judicial investigations into human rights abuses in Chile and Argentina that underpin Garzon's arrest warrant. Pinochet's family issued a statement Sunday calling the arrest an insult and thanking the Chilean government, rightist politicians and the military for their support. In London, British officials keep insisting that Pinochet's case will be decided by the courts and not politically, yet the issue has stirred intense political activity both in Britain and in Chile. In Madrid, Baltasar Garzon, the Spanish investigating magistrate who first obtained Pinochet's arrest in London, said he had formally requested the governments of Switzerland and Luxemburg to block bank accounts held by the general.
