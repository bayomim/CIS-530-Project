Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make an appropriate concession to break the deadlock over forming a government. FUNCINPEC has demanded from Hun Sen written guarantees for the safety of its members and activities as a precondition for re-entering negotiations.
 Cambodian leader Hun Sen, who heads the CPP, has offered to share the legislature's top job with the royalist FUNCINPEC party of Prince Norodom Ranariddh in order to break the impasse. 
Sihanouk reported that Hun Sen responded positively to a request by Ranariddh for five of his key supporters to receive political pardons. Earlier, as both sides arrived at the Royal Palace for a second day of meetings, Sihanouk said they had agreed in principle to form a coalition and made important concessions. Pok Than, one of Ranariddh's negotiators, said the Senate would serve a mostly advisory role to the assembly. Instead, Sihanouk announced, the constitution will be modified to create a new Senate, which Chea Sim will head.

The platform is said to emphasize administrative, economic and judicial reforms, but Sok An would not reveal details, saying Hun Sen would announce it when he presents his Cabinet choices to the National Assembly.
 Sam Rainsy wrote in a letter to King Norodom Sihanouk that he was eager to attend the first session of the new National Assembly on Nov. 
The protocol on cooperation between the CPP and FUNCINPEC will certainly bring peace and progress to our nation and people, Sihanouk wrote. Hun Sen said Monday that the CPP and FUNCINPEC had agreed that the Senate would be half as large as the 122-seat National Assembly. Key to the agreement was the formation of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly.
