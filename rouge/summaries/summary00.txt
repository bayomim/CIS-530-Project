17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability prevent efforts to set up a new government, Hun Sen said in a televised speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. 
Cambodia's two-party opposition asked the Asian Development Bank Monday to stop providing loans to the incumbent government, which it calls illegal. Hun Sen complained Monday that the opposition was trying to make its members return an international issue. There have been reports that there is an attempt to internationalize the return of those members of parliament on the excuse of security problems, Prak Sokhonn said. 
It defended Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh as a proper response to the prince's attempts at the time to negotiate the defections of senior Khmer Rouge rebels. human rights workers in the aftermath of the coup were dismissed by the CPP as mostly fabrications meant to distort the political situation. The opposition claims the grenade attack was staged as an excuse to begin the crackdown. Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. 
In the most recent elections, held in July, Hun Sen's party collected 64 of the 122 parliamentary seats, but was short of the two-thirds majority needed to set up a new government. Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the legislative body. Disputes over the presidency have been a major stumbling block in talks between the two-party opposition bloc and the Cambodian People's Party to form a new government. 
The senior Senate leaders will join those of the assembly, the prime minister and the country's top two Buddhist monks in a delicate balance of power on the council that will choose Cambodia's next king after Sihanouk dies. The major political crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an end, the king said in his statement. Ranariddh's party and opposition ally Sam Rainsy held back their support, claiming the CPP won due to fraud and intimidation. 
After a three-month impasse, they agreed last week to a coalition deal that will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly.

Last week, Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party and Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party agreed to form a coalition that would leave Hun Sen as sole prime minister and make the prince president of the National Assembly. I don't think there is any benefit for Hun Sen to cause instability for our country, Ranariddh said. The assurances were aimed especially at Sam Rainsy, leader of a vocally anti-Hun Sen opposition party, who was forced to take refuge in the U.N. 
Hun Sen announced a government guarantee Wednesday of all politicians safety and their right to conduct political activities in accordance with the laws in force. Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC party finished a close second in the election, returned last week and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. 
The remaining senators, he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government and the National Assembly. Key to the agreement was the formation of a Senate as the upper house of Parliament, to be led by CPP President Chea Sim, the outgoing head of the National Assembly. The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July election narrowly won by Hun Sen.
