Government and opposition parties have asked King Norodom Sihanouk to host a summit meeting after a series of post-election negotiations between the two opposition groups and Hun Sen's party to form a new government failed. But the ruling party refuses to negotiate unless it is able to threaten its negotiating partners with arrest or worse.
 Cambodian leader Hun Sen on Friday rejected opposition parties demands for talks outside the country, accusing them of trying to internationalize the political crisis. 
Hun Sen implied Thursday that the opposition failed to follow through on promises made at the summit. Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government on its own. In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises to end the stalemate : Papa would like to ask all three parties to take responsibility before the nation and the people. 
Hun Sen's ruling party narrowly won a majority in elections in July, but the opposition claiming widespread intimidation and fraud has denied Hun Sen the two-thirds vote in parliament required to approve the next government. The opposition has insisted that any further talks on the next government must take place outside the country, but the ruling party has rejected allegations of intimidation and recently guaranteed opposition members safety inside the country. 
Ranariddh and his core supporters did not return to Cambodia until a few months before an election in July this year that the ruling party narrowly won. Cambodia's ruling party responded Tuesday to criticisms of its leader in the U.S. The ruling party also reminded the United States that Washington supported a Cambodian exile government dominated by the brutal Khmer Rouge in the 1980s. Ranariddh and his opposition ally, Sam Rainsy, refused to accept the election results, alleging widespread intimidation and fraud by the CPP. 
Hun Sen's party recently called on Ranariddh to return to the negotiation table and said it was willing to make an appropriate concession to break the deadlock over forming a government. The prince's party, in a statement dated Friday and seen Saturday, said such a scenario was unconstitutional. Cambodia's leading opposition party ruled out sharing the presidency of Parliament with its arch foe Saturday, insisting it alone must occupy the top position in the legislative body. 
The major political crisis in the country has been resolved and the political deadlock facing the nation has also come to an end, the king said in his statement. Cambodia's bickering political parties broke a three-month deadlock Friday and agreed to a coalition government leaving strongman Hun Sen as sole prime minister, King Norodom Sihanouk announced. The CPP fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to form a government alone. His 15 seats in the 122-seat assembly are irrelevant to forming a working government.
 
The prince fled Cambodia and did not return until a few months before elections in July. The parties are to form working groups this week to divide remaining government posts and draft a constitutional amendment to form a new Senate. Cambodian politicians expressed hope Monday that a new partnership between the parties of strongman Hun Sen and his rival, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, in a coalition government would not end in more violence. When we had two prime ministers, everything moved very slowly and decisions were made more politically than technically. 
Speaking upon his return from a brief stay in Bangkok, the prince said he would soon meet with Hun Sen to discuss the apportioning of ministries in the new coalition government. He's got the premiership and legitimacy through the election and recognition from his majesty the king. It should be easy for them to say, Rainsy and the SRP members of the assembly have no charges against them and will not be arrested,'' the opposition leader said in a statement. 
Ranariddh, whose FUNCINPEC party finished a close second in the election, returned last week and struck a deal with Hun Sen to form a coalition government. The alleged assassination attempt came during massive street demonstrations organized by the opposition after Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party narrowly won the election. Worried that party colleagues still face arrest for their politics, opposition leader Sam Rainsy sought further clarification Friday of security guarantees promised by strongman Hun Sen. 
King Norodom Sihanouk on Tuesday praised agreements by Cambodia's top two political parties previously bitter rivals to form a coalition government led by strongman Hun Sen. The deal, which will make Hun Sen prime minister and Ranariddh president of the National Assembly, ended more than three months of political deadlock that followed a July election narrowly won by Hun Sen. The remaining senators, he said, should be selected by a method agreed upon by the new government and the National Assembly.
