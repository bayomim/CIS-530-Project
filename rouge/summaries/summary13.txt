The Democratic surge marked the first time since 1934 that the president's party had gained seats in a midterm election, and it whittled the Republican House majority down to a mere six votes. But by his own admission, Gingrich's vision seems to have blurred this time around, costing Republicans a net of five seats in Tuesday's election and leaving the party's narrow governing majority even narrower. The anger grew in the last few days when the speaker approved a$ 10-million anti-Clinton advertising campaign that allowed Democrats to turn the election into a referendum on Gingrich, who has never been nearly as popular with the public as Clinton has been. Clinton said : Newt Gingrich has been a worthy adversary leading the Republican Party to a majority in the House and joining me in a great national debate over how best to prepare America for the 21st century. Stunned by the Democratic resurgence in the mid-term elections, congressional Republicans tore into each other Wednesday over who was to blame for their failure to make the traditional opposition party gains in an off-year election.
