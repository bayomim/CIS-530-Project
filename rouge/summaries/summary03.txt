But at least one operative of bin Laden's group in East Africa concluded more than a year ago that he knew the identity of a crucial turncoat : Sidi Tayyib, a businessman who was married to one of bin Laden's relatives. Albania says it has uncovered a terrorist network operated by Osama Bin Laden, the Islamic fundamentalist accused of masterminding the August embassy bombings in Africa, and that it's members have infiltrated other parts of Europe, The Sunday Times reported. From the court papers filed in the investigation of the embassy bombings in East Africa in August, it is clear that the informant has provided crucial information to federal investigators. The timing is potentially important because there have been mounting questions since the bombings about whether the United States adequately followed up warnings of a possible terrorist attack on American targets in Kenya. Bin Laden is believed to have established an Albanian operation in 1994 after telling the government that he was head of a wealthy Saudi humanitarian agency wishing to help in Albania, the newspaper reported.
