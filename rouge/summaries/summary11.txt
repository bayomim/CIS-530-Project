Horses belonging to Iran's equestrian team will not be allowed to compete in next month's Asian Games because they failed to meet the requirements of the games veterinary commission, the Thai organizers announced Thursday. The body governing the games threatened several times to award Asia's version of the Olympics to other countries, but Thailand argued that all would be ready by opening day. China's national soccer team could call back four players from overseas to boost its chances at the Asian Games in Thailand in December, an official newspaper reported Monday. We have financial problems in all of Asia but still we are able to prepare commendably, said Manuel Veguillas, head of the Philippine delegation. Another performance celebrating the unity of Asia capped the show, with four large swan floats pulled to the middle of the field, each tethered to a giant balloon symbolizing the sun, moon, earth and a giant lotus. Several Indian team members went to the playing arena, and one of them wrote a quick protest letter using the snooker table as a writing platform.
