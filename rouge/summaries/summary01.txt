Nicaraguan Vice President Enrique Bolanos said Sunday night that between 1,000 and 1,500 people were buried in a 32-square mile( 82.88 square-kilometer) area below the slopes of the Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua. It's a coincidence that the ships are there but they've got men and equipment that can be put to work in an organized way, said International Development Secretary Clare Short. EU spokesman Pietro Petrucci said the funds will be used to provide basic care such as medicine, food, water sanitation and blankets to thousands of people whose homes were destroyed by torrential rains and mudslides. In the flood-ravaged Tegucigalpa neighborhood of Nueva Esperanza, Mexican military rescuers loaded search dogs on their backs and forded a muddy river to look for people believed buried in a 200-foot( 60-meter) avalanche that occurred last Friday. At least 231 people have been confirmed dead in Honduras from former-hurricane Mitch, bringing the storm's death toll in the region to 357, the National Emergency Commission said Saturday.
